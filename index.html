        <h2>List of Overrated Fast Foods</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Big Mac
                <img src="bigmac_bb.png" height="300" width="300" alt="Big Mac burger image">
                <p>This is the worst food I have ever eaten, and I have no idea why it's so popular. It is not even that good, maybe good for those too lazy to cook 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Whopper Burger
                <img src="bb_whopper-v1-min_1.png" height="300" width="300" alt="Whopper burger image">
                <p>Same type as Big Mac but with a different name and also more expensive. You must be very rich to eat this junk on a daily basis 💰💰💰.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                McNuggets

                <p>Nuggets are not bad, just don't eat 50 McNuggets a day and you'll be fine.</p>
            </li>
